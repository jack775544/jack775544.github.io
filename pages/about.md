My name is Jack Kerr and I am a Information Technology student at the University of Queensland. My primary areas of interest are in the fields of web development and database administration.

I have experience in a range of modern software tools and programming languages including, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, Python, Java, SQL and more.

You can find some of the projects that I have worked on <a href="{{ " /projects/ " | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
