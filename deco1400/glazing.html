			<strong>Glazing</strong><br/><br/>
			Whether you call it Refinishing, Reglazing, or Resurfacing, there are two basic types of coatings used in this line of work, and we are pleased to offer both. The first is an Epoxy based coating, and the second is an Acrylic Urethane based coating. The materials are quite distinct, and the differences are detailed below.
			<br/><br/>
			The Big difference between cheap & high quality coatings is the number of chemical bonds holding the molecules together. As the cross-link density gets higher, the higher the overall film durability and coating life span. Ours High Performance coating is specifically designed for the Bathtub Resurfacing. This fully linked system offers our customers the most long-term value, as compared to low-link coatings used by other area companies. 
			<br/><br/>
			Our 4 hour cure coating means you can use your bathtub the same day, which we know consumers appreciate. No long delays and return trips to clean up saves you time and money too. Add to that is the fact that this fully linked Aliphatic Acrylic urethane offers a 4H pencil hardness and is rated 10 in scuff and mar tests which translates into one tough coating that looks great and will last and last. It’s so tough that it's used in Marine, Aerospace and Industrial environments, and will stand up to your homes use too.  At Bath Magic, we prefer to use the best materials on the market.
